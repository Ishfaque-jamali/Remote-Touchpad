# Remote-Touchpad

This project develops a remote-controlled touchpad Android app that lets users control a desktop's mouse using their phone via Wi-Fi. It converts touch gestures into real-time mouse actions. A lightweight server on the desktop receives commands via socket programming for smooth, low-latency control on a local network.
